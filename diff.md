Git diff
========

`git diff` is used to show the changes between:
- what's in the current folder vs the staging area; or if nothing staged
- what's in the current folder vs the last commit

Examples:
---------
- `git diff` : show changes between current folder and staging area / last commit (if nothing staged)
- `git diff --staged` : show changes between staging area and last commit
