git checkout
============

Two main functions:
- use with a branch name to check out a particular branch;
- use with a filename to replace the working directory's version with the last committed version

Examples:
---------
- `git checkout -- <file1> <file2> <...>` : Replace the working directory versions of <file1>, <file2>, <etc> with the versions most 
                                            recently committed.
