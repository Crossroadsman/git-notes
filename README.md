[The Three Trees][link01]
-----------------
Note: Git's data structure is a node and pointer structure, not a tree.

The trees:
- the working directory (this is in sync with the local filesystem)
- the staging index (aka, the cache)
- the commit history


[The Four Objects][link02]
------------------
- BLOB ('binary large object')
- tree
- commit
- annotated tag
